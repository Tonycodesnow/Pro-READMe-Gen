  ## Installation
  Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies. Have (Node.js) https://nodejs.org/en/ installed and (inquirer) https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer. I used resources such as (shield.oi) https://shields.io/category/build and licenses from https://choosealicense.com/licenses/. This app was built with Javascript.
